A (hopefully) simple way to store and track the challenges.

I copy/paste and rename the daily folders ("01", "02", etc) as the days go on.

Each daily folder has a solution with an A and B project for the normal and hard challenges. The projects share an input file, so replace that with the daily challenge's file.

Last year I had just 1 file I used to solve both challenges in, but that eventually got really messy. Even though a lot of things were similar between the normal and hard challenges, it become difficult to keep the code working for the normal challenge as I mangled it to work with the hard challenge.

In this setup, I can just copy my progress from the normal challenge into the hard challenge and not worry about messing up my previous work.
